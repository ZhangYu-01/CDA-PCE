# CDA-PCE
This is a novel method for reliability analysis based on CDA and PCE
The core code is for the CDA-DRM-FPCE in the paper "Efficient reliability analysis with a CDA-based dimension-reduction model
and polynomial chaos expansion"
CDA-DRM-SPCE in the paper just futher uses the stepwise regression 
We use existing codes( "Hermite_PC.m" and "multi_index.m") to establish Hermite PCE, the authors of these codes are highly appreciated 
"Example1.m" is the main code
